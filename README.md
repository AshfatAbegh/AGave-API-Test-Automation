# Agave-API-Test-Automation
 Agave is a Japanese company specializing in providing a wide selection of small houseplants through a mobile application, complemented by an admin portal for management purposes. Initially, it showcased its botanical wonders on Instagram. However, with the overwhelming demand for its exquisite plants, Agave aspired to establish and manage a dedicated sales platform. 

# This repository is dedicated to API test automation using RestAssured, providing comprehensive coverage of all HTTP methods—GET, POST, PUT, DELETE—for API testing. The framework is built with a focus on scalability, efficiency, and thorough validation.

Key highlights:

1) Test Frameworks: Leveraging both TestNG and JUnit for test execution, enabling structured assertions and detailed validation of API responses.
2) JSON Schema Validation: Ensures that the API responses conform to the expected structure, improving reliability and consistency in testing.
3) Comprehensive API Coverage: Automates the testing of all common API requests, ensuring full lifecycle testing from request to response.
4) Reporting: Integrated with the Maven Surefire Plugin for generating test reports, with additional support for Surefire TestNG Reports to provide clear, actionable insights into test outcomes.

This project is tailored for seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring reliable API test automation in modern development workflows.
